🩺 Predictive Healthcare Analytics — Patient Outcome Prediction

Machine Learning + Deep Learning framework to predict patient outcomes using structured clinical data.  
Includes XGBoost, LightGBM, SMOTE, PCA, t-SNE, and a real-time Streamlit dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a complete ML pipeline to predict patient outcomes using demographic, clinical and treatment variables.  
It includes:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Class balancing (SMOTE)  
- PCA for dimensionality reduction  
- t-SNE visualization  
- Multiple ML model training  
- Model evaluation  
- Best-model selection  
- A real-time Streamlit prediction dashboard  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Healthcare providers need reliable tools to identify high-risk patients early.  
This system predicts whether a patient is likely to experience a negative outcome (0/1), helping hospitals:

- Prioritize treatment  
- Allocate resources  
- Understand key risk factors

## 🧠 Features

### **Data Preprocessing**
✔ Missing value handling  
✔ One-hot encoding  
✔ Normalization  
✔ Train/Test split  
✔ Cleaned dataset generated automatically  

### **Machine Learning Models**

This repo trains & compares:

- **XGBoost (best model — saved as `best_model.pkl`)**
- LightGBM  
- Random Forest  
- Logistic Regression  
- MLP Neural Network
